Task-4 : Mp3 Player

This Python code creates a basic MP3 player application using the pygame and tkinter libraries. It initializes the pygame mixer for sound playback and creates a tkinter window with buttons for opening an MP3 file, playing/pausing the playback, and stopping it. When an MP3 file is opened, it loads and plays the file, updating a status label to reflect the current playback state. The play/pause button toggles between play and pause states, while the stop button halts the playback. After the tkinter event loop finishes, it cleanly shuts down the pygame mixer.
